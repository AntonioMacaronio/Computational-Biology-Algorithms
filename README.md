This is a repository of computational biology algorithms which show various visualizations and applications of computational biology algorithms. Such examples include the Z-algorithm, suffix tree construction, Burrow-Wheeler transform, and Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. 

Coupled with the implementation, there are visualizations of to further understand how these algorithms work, and how we can apply them to solve problems in genetics such as the exact matching problem, gene compression, and genomic alignment.
